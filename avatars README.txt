before doing anything:
DO NOT DELETE the generic.gif image inside \Graphics\Player avatar. It's the image currently being used as fallback.

1.Drop the image you want to use as a avatar in the following folder:
\Graphics\Player avatar

2. Go to the folder that corresponds to your profile, it's usually in:
%AppData%\Roaming\StepMania 5\Save\LocalProfiles\<some 8 digit number>
or 
Stepmania Program Folder\Save\LocalProfiles\<some 8 digit number> if you use portable.ini

3.Inside your profile folder, make a text file called avatar.txt.

4. Inside the avatar.txt text file, write down the image name with extensions with notepad (or anything similar)
e.g: stepman.png

5. Save the avatar.txt file and reload stepmania. It should show whenever you play as that profile.
