# spawncamping-wallhack
A WIP Stepmania 5 theme aimed primarily for KB players. 

Requirements: StepMania 5.0.8 or later.

It's being made on StepMania 5.0.9 for a 16:9 display. (Anything between 4:3 and 16:9 will work now but some elements will rather watered-down for non-widescreen displays)

##### Current Issues
* Everything blows up for rave and various course modes. (I disabled it from the menus for now)
* SMO works but it's somewhat messy, also you can't grab any server-side scores.

---
##### To be added soon 
* Info for various tabs on ScreenSelectMusic (Song tab is incomplete, profile tab is still disabled.)
* Theme color config screen.
* More mouse interactions.

##### Acknowledgements
* The StepMania 5 devs (notably freem and Kyzentun) for making this possible in the first place.
* people in #vsrg,#stepmania-devs and various other people for feedbacks..!
* ScreenFilter.lua was taken from the Default theme by Midiman.
* CDTitle Resizer, ScreenSelectMusic Backgrounds are adapted from Jousway's code.
* Kyzentun's prefs system is used for setting various profile/theme preferences.
