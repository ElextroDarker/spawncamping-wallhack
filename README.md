# spawncamping-wallhack
A WIP Stepmania 5 theme aimed primarily for KB players.
Hopefully won't be as broken as the ultralight-fork I made previously.


It's currently being made on StepMania 5.0.7 for a 16:9 display. 
(I don't think I can do 4:3 because everything is already cramped as is)

##### Current Issues
* Every screen except for like 3 is still _fallback (rip)
* Scoretracking still tracks scores while autoplay is enabled.
* Everything blows up for rave and various course modes. (I disabled it from the menus for now)
* SMO works but it's somewhat messy, also you can't grab any server-side scores.
* Scripts for fetching various stuff are kinda everywhere right now. Needs some cleanup.

##### To be added soon 
* Title menu
* CDTitles for ScreenSelectMusic
* Pacemaker graph (not porting the ultralight-edit one because it's really messy-)
* Info for various tabs on ScreenSelectMusic
* scoreboard for eval screen from ultralight-edit
